00:00:30,000 --> 01:11:59,000
hey guns and welcome back to another

3
00:34:30,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Kibby tutorial so in today's video I'm

5
01:11:59,000 --> 02:04:30,000
gonna be showing you how to create

7
01:31:00,000 --> 02:42:30,000
pop-up windows which is actually very

9
02:04:30,000 --> 03:10:00,000
useful and it's super simple to do this

11
02:42:30,000 --> 03:40:59,000
as well so I'm just gonna start and kind

13
03:10:00,000 --> 04:15:30,000
of build a very basic interface

15
03:40:59,000 --> 04:48:30,000
I like GUI and then we're gonna get to

17
04:15:30,000 --> 05:06:30,000
actually using those pop-ups putting

19
04:48:30,000 --> 05:25:00,000
them on the screen some of the different

21
05:06:30,000 --> 06:01:29,000
options how you can add different

23
05:25:00,000 --> 06:30:30,000
widgets to it and all that so

25
06:01:29,000 --> 06:52:59,000
essentially I have all these things

27
06:30:30,000 --> 07:32:30,000
imported we've talked about them before

29
06:52:59,000 --> 08:02:00,000
a widget object property label import

31
07:32:30,000 --> 08:35:00,000
float layout so I also need to just

33
08:02:00,000 --> 09:38:59,000
import pop-up so I'm going to do is

35
08:35:00,000 --> 10:25:59,000
Kavita uix top pop up and we'll import

37
09:38:59,000 --> 10:47:59,000
pop up like that now what I'll actually

39
10:25:59,000 --> 11:19:30,000
start by doing it just show you guys

41
10:47:59,000 --> 11:36:30,000
right away how to make the pop and then

43
11:19:30,000 --> 12:08:30,000
I'll work into how we can actually

45
11:36:30,000 --> 12:38:30,000
display it onto the screen and like

47
12:08:30,000 --> 12:57:29,000
trigger that event and whatnot so I'm

49
12:38:30,000 --> 13:52:30,000
gonna create a function I'm just gonna

51
12:57:29,000 --> 14:32:00,000
call this show underscore pop-up like

53
13:52:30,000 --> 14:59:29,000
this okay it doesn't need any parameters

55
14:32:00,000 --> 15:50:00,000
and all we're gonna do in here is we're

57
14:59:29,000 --> 16:19:30,000
gonna create a pop-up window and show it

59
15:50:00,000 --> 16:43:00,000
and that way whenever we want to create

61
16:19:30,000 --> 17:16:30,000
a pop-up all we have to do is just

63
16:43:00,000 --> 17:53:59,000
simply call this function and it'll do

65
17:16:30,000 --> 18:49:59,000
that for us so you could put this as a

67
17:53:59,000 --> 19:24:00,000
method Sapor inside your widget class or

69
18:49:59,000 --> 20:01:00,000
inside your my app I'm just gonna leave

71
19:24:00,000 --> 20:26:00,000
it as a function obviously feel free to

73
20:01:00,000 --> 20:57:30,000
do whatever you want so to create a

75
20:26:00,000 --> 21:41:30,000
pop-up what we need to do is need to

77
20:57:30,000 --> 22:02:30,000
have some content for that pop-up so

79
21:41:30,000 --> 22:25:00,000
actually that leads me do we need to

81
22:02:30,000 --> 22:53:50,000
create another class so I'm gonna create

83
22:25:00,000 --> 23:40:00,000
a class I'm just gonna call this P

85
22:53:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
standing for pop-up and all I'm gonna do

87
23:40:00,000 --> 00:55:29,000
is pass in here and I'm just gonna come

89
00:11:59,000 --> 01:16:30,000
to my my dog f K V final sorry that's

91
00:55:29,000 --> 01:40:00,000
already empty and what I'm gonna do in

93
01:16:30,000 --> 02:33:20,000
here is I'm just going to define a few

95
01:40:00,000 --> 03:19:29,000
widgets that I want to go inside of my

97
02:33:20,000 --> 03:41:29,000
what do you call it my pop-up or whatnot

99
03:19:29,000 --> 04:17:00,000
so what I'm actually gonna do sir is go

101
03:41:29,000 --> 04:44:30,000
back here I'm getting sidetracked and

103
04:17:00,000 --> 05:11:59,000
I'm just gonna make this inherit from

105
04:44:30,000 --> 05:57:00,000
float layout because what I want my

107
05:11:59,000 --> 06:38:00,000
pop-up window to be is a float layout

109
05:57:00,000 --> 07:01:29,000
that contains a few different widgets so

111
06:38:00,000 --> 07:19:59,000
this is this to be nice you as I'll see

113
07:01:29,000 --> 07:57:00,000
how this works essentially we have a

115
07:19:59,000 --> 08:26:30,000
class P inherits from float layout and

117
07:57:00,000 --> 08:55:30,000
now we have P and what we're gonna do

119
08:26:30,000 --> 09:18:59,000
here is on a few widgets and since this

121
08:55:30,000 --> 10:02:00,000
inherits from float layout we can use

123
09:18:59,000 --> 10:36:30,000
the size pause and or what am I saying

125
10:02:00,000 --> 11:03:30,000
size pause size hint and pause hints

127
10:36:30,000 --> 11:30:29,000
that we've used before so let's just

129
11:03:30,000 --> 12:24:29,000
start off with a label I will just say

131
11:30:29,000 --> 12:48:10,000
the label has a text and the text will

133
12:24:29,000 --> 14:05:40,000
just say like you

135
12:48:10,000 --> 14:41:10,000
you pressed the button hello that okay

137
14:05:40,000 --> 15:13:40,000
and then we'll do size underscore hint

139
14:41:10,000 --> 15:33:40,000
and for size underscore hint it can be

141
15:13:40,000 --> 16:06:10,000
honestly whatever you want it does

143
15:33:40,000 --> 16:59:40,000
really matter I'm just gonna do 0.6 0.2

145
16:06:10,000 --> 17:21:40,000
and 4 pause underscore hints this one

147
16:59:40,000 --> 17:41:10,000
will be a bit different I want this to

149
17:21:40,000 --> 18:33:40,000
be at the top of the screen

151
17:41:10,000 --> 19:03:40,000
so we'll do X and we'll do 0.2 just so

153
18:33:40,000 --> 20:16:40,000
we get that centered and then we'll do

155
19:03:40,000 --> 20:47:40,000
why I should not why let's do top of one

157
20:16:40,000 --> 21:10:10,000
so we go right up to the top now I'll

159
20:47:40,000 --> 21:44:10,000
copy this I'm just going to do the same

161
21:10:10,000 --> 22:12:10,000
or a similar thing with a button

163
21:44:10,000 --> 22:48:40,000
so we'll just change this to B button

165
22:12:10,000 --> 23:40:40,000
and you guys can see how this works so

167
22:48:40,000 --> 23:57:40,000
the button instead of going for 0.6

169
23:40:40,000 --> 00:51:40,000
let's go 0.8

171
23:57:40,000 --> 02:12:40,000
let's go X 0.1 and we'll change this to

173
00:51:40,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Y and 0.1 so now if we actually use P it

175
02:12:40,000 --> 03:11:40,000
should have like a label up top and then

177
02:39:40,000 --> 03:29:10,000
a button slightly below it and that's

179
03:11:40,000 --> 04:03:40,000
all we need and obviously you guys know

181
03:29:10,000 --> 04:32:40,000
how to add things into like your classes

183
04:03:40,000 --> 05:10:10,000
and float layouts and whatnot okay so we

185
04:32:40,000 --> 05:38:10,000
have our float layout here we have

187
05:10:10,000 --> 06:15:40,000
widgets we'll do something that in a

189
05:38:10,000 --> 06:44:10,000
second but let's get into pop-up down so

191
06:15:40,000 --> 07:29:10,000
essentially the content for our pop-up

193
06:44:10,000 --> 07:58:40,000
is going to be P right so what we need

195
07:29:10,000 --> 08:36:10,000
to do is I'm just going to say show is

197
07:58:40,000 --> 09:11:40,000
equal to and we'll create a new instance

199
08:36:10,000 --> 09:35:10,000
of P and that's just so that we can use

201
09:11:40,000 --> 09:58:40,000
this in what we're gonna do in a second

203
09:35:10,000 --> 10:57:30,000
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to

205
09:58:40,000 --> 11:56:10,000
say pop should we say let's just say

207
10:57:30,000 --> 12:18:10,000
pop-up window I don't want to name it

209
11:56:10,000 --> 13:12:10,000
the same thing as the class that's why

211
12:18:10,000 --> 13:45:10,000
I'm okay so pop-up window equals pop-up

213
13:12:10,000 --> 14:13:10,000
and then in here we have a few things we

215
13:45:10,000 --> 14:35:40,000
can use we can use first of all title

217
14:13:10,000 --> 14:56:10,000
now obviously the title is gonna be

219
14:35:40,000 --> 15:51:40,000
what's at the top of your box in this

221
14:56:10,000 --> 16:49:10,000
case I'm just gonna say pop-up window

223
15:51:40,000 --> 17:17:10,000
okay we have content now the content

225
16:49:10,000 --> 17:48:40,000
remember is gonna be equal to P because

227
17:17:10,000 --> 18:24:40,000
that's what we set here so say content

229
17:48:40,000 --> 18:58:40,000
is or not P it's show because that's

231
18:24:40,000 --> 19:26:40,000
where we're storing P and then what else

233
18:58:40,000 --> 19:49:10,000
do we have well we have a we can there's

235
19:26:40,000 --> 20:32:10,000
a bunch of other parameters that we can

237
19:49:10,000 --> 21:20:10,000
use as well but we're gonna use a size

239
20:32:10,000 --> 21:45:10,000
hint and pause hint as well so I believe

241
21:20:10,000 --> 22:37:10,000
actually it might just be size I gotta

243
21:45:10,000 --> 23:07:10,000
check no its size is size handicapped so

245
22:37:10,000 --> 23:42:10,000
size hint and the here I'm just gonna

247
23:07:10,000 --> 00:14:09,000
type none none because I don't want this

249
23:42:10,000 --> 00:51:40,000
to dynamically resize I want to just be

251
00:14:09,000 --> 01:36:40,000
equal to these same size no matter what

253
00:51:40,000 --> 01:56:09,000
so size hint equals sorry none none and

255
01:36:40,000 --> 02:39:40,000
then we're gonna do

257
01:56:09,000 --> 03:48:39,000
sighs for a static size is going to be

259
02:39:40,000 --> 04:16:09,000
equal to 400 400 now you can change the

261
03:48:39,000 --> 04:39:39,000
position as well but by default it's

263
04:16:09,000 --> 05:13:40,000
gonna come in the middle of the screen

265
04:39:39,000 --> 05:31:09,000
which is probably what you want so if

267
05:13:40,000 --> 05:56:39,000
you want to read the dog since you don't

269
05:31:09,000 --> 06:50:40,000
do that feel free but essentially this

271
05:56:39,000 --> 07:18:10,000
is what you usually will want to do now

273
06:50:40,000 --> 07:45:10,000
to actually show this window you don't

275
07:18:10,000 --> 07:51:39,000
have to add it to a widget or anything

277
07:45:10,000 --> 08:10:39,000
like that

279
07:51:39,000 --> 09:14:09,000
all you have to do is literally just do

281
08:10:39,000 --> 10:11:10,000
pop-up window dot show I want to say or

283
09:14:09,000 --> 10:37:10,000
is it dot huh let's see open that's what

285
10:11:10,000 --> 11:17:40,000
this sir I have it open on my other

287
10:37:10,000 --> 11:35:09,000
screen sighs forget ok so dot open so

289
11:17:40,000 --> 12:09:09,000
once you've created this pop-up window

291
11:35:09,000 --> 12:44:10,000
you have the content you've set the

293
12:09:09,000 --> 13:28:09,000
sizes here the reason we do this is just

295
12:44:10,000 --> 13:57:40,000
so that we override it with this like

297
13:28:09,000 --> 14:29:09,000
absolute size so it doesn't try to

299
13:57:40,000 --> 14:58:40,000
dynamically resize and then we just

301
14:29:09,000 --> 15:16:39,000
opening it up and it'll just go on top

303
14:58:40,000 --> 15:40:39,000
of whatever window we already have

305
15:16:39,000 --> 16:41:10,000
created which is really nice and saves

307
15:40:39,000 --> 17:06:40,000
us a lot of time now we have this pop-up

309
16:41:10,000 --> 17:35:09,000
window now but how do we actually

311
17:06:40,000 --> 18:11:09,000
trigger this and get it to run what what

313
17:35:09,000 --> 18:54:09,000
we need to do is create a widget inside

315
18:11:09,000 --> 19:13:09,000
of our widgets class ideally a button

317
18:54:09,000 --> 19:44:39,000
and when we press that button we're

319
19:13:09,000 --> 20:01:10,000
gonna trigger this function so first of

321
19:44:39,000 --> 20:31:39,000
all I'm just gonna say well we're

323
20:01:10,000 --> 21:22:09,000
already here in this widgets class I'm

325
20:31:39,000 --> 22:15:10,000
just gonna say define BTN okay and BTN

327
21:22:09,000 --> 22:47:30,000
will do this is just simply gonna call

329
22:15:10,000 --> 23:55:39,000
popup window so we'll just do this

331
22:47:30,000 --> 00:50:29,000
pop-up window don't know why that's not

333
23:55:39,000 --> 01:44:39,000
showing for me anyways this should work

335
00:50:29,000 --> 02:16:10,000
pop-up window Oh show underscore pop-up

337
01:44:39,000 --> 03:09:09,000
is what I called it my bad show

339
02:16:10,000 --> 03:36:09,000
underscore pop-up

341
03:09:09,000 --> 04:21:10,000
okay so now we're just going to call

343
03:36:09,000 --> 04:50:09,000
this function whenever this method is

345
04:21:10,000 --> 05:07:40,000
called so to call this method well first

347
04:50:09,000 --> 05:44:10,000
of all we need to create something for

349
05:07:40,000 --> 06:42:09,000
widgets so like we've done before we'll

351
05:44:10,000 --> 07:07:09,000
just do widgets and then in here we can

353
06:42:09,000 --> 07:29:10,000
just simply create a button and I'm not

355
07:07:09,000 --> 07:50:39,000
gonna worry about really sizing this or

357
07:29:10,000 --> 08:27:40,000
anything I'm just gonna simply make a

359
07:50:39,000 --> 09:35:39,000
button it'll say text and the text will

361
08:27:40,000 --> 10:27:09,000
just be equal to press me okay and then

363
09:35:39,000 --> 11:04:39,000
we'll say on underscore release all

365
10:27:09,000 --> 11:39:10,000
we're gonna do is gonna do route BTN and

367
11:04:39,000 --> 12:08:39,000
remember root is gonna call this widget

369
11:39:10,000 --> 12:36:09,000
class which just means it's gonna call

371
12:08:39,000 --> 13:08:09,000
this method okay

373
12:36:09,000 --> 13:42:39,000
awesome so let's run this and see if

375
13:08:09,000 --> 14:16:09,000
everything's working okay so you see a

377
13:42:39,000 --> 14:50:09,000
button we say press me and when we press

379
14:16:09,000 --> 15:02:10,000
press me it pops up a window that says

381
14:50:09,000 --> 15:32:10,000
pop-up when

383
15:02:10,000 --> 16:00:10,000
you press the button and then there is

385
15:32:10,000 --> 16:30:40,000
obviously another button in here that

387
16:00:10,000 --> 16:52:10,000
says you press the button now if you

389
16:30:40,000 --> 17:28:40,000
want to add more things to this you

391
16:52:10,000 --> 17:47:40,000
could go ahead and do that you know how

393
17:28:40,000 --> 18:22:10,000
to now that we've created this little

395
17:47:40,000 --> 18:45:10,000
class for it now to get out in this

397
18:22:10,000 --> 19:19:40,000
pop-up you just click anywhere else on

399
18:45:10,000 --> 19:46:10,000
the screen you can see it disappears and

401
19:19:40,000 --> 20:07:40,000
this is really nice and I don't know I

403
19:46:10,000 --> 20:33:10,000
think this pop-up looks pretty clean and

405
20:07:40,000 --> 20:56:40,000
you can really you can dynamically

407
20:33:10,000 --> 21:33:10,000
change the size and do a lot of things

409
20:56:40,000 --> 21:52:10,000
with it I think it's very useful um so

411
21:33:10,000 --> 22:14:40,000
anyway so that's gonna be it for this

413
21:52:10,000 --> 22:42:40,000
