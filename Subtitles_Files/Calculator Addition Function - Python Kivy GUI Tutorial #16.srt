what's going on guys john elder here

3
00:25:20,000 --> 01:08:00,000
from coding.com and in this video

5
00:50:40,000 --> 01:37:19,000
we're going to work on the addition

7
01:08:00,000 --> 02:18:39,000
function for a calculator with kivy and

9
01:37:19,000 --> 02:18:39,000
python

11
03:57:20,000 --> 04:36:00,000
all right guys like i said in this video

13
04:19:59,000 --> 04:58:40,000
we're going to work on the addition

15
04:36:00,000 --> 05:19:59,000
function for our calculator

17
04:58:40,000 --> 05:37:20,000

hope you had a great holiday in this

55
12:13:20,000 --> 12:57:20,000
video like i said we're going to work on

57
12:32:00,000 --> 13:26:39,000
the addition function so we've got 99

59
12:57:20,000 --> 14:30:39,000
plus one we hit equal to

61
13:26:39,000 --> 15:36:00,000
boom it hits 100 so we can go 9 plus 3

63
14:30:39,000 --> 16:06:40,000
12 plus 56

65
15:36:00,000 --> 16:37:20,000
68 whatever so that's what we're going

67
16:06:40,000 --> 17:27:59,000
to work on in this video so i've got our

69
16:37:20,000 --> 17:48:00,000
calc.pi file and calc.kv file

71
17:27:59,000 --> 18:13:20,000
from the last video if you didn't see

73
17:48:00,000 --> 18:40:00,000
that video check the link in the comment

75
18:13:20,000 --> 19:25:20,000
section below for the playlist

77
18:40:00,000 --> 19:58:40,000
and the first thing i'm going to do is

79
19:25:20,000 --> 20:13:19,000
head over here and anytime we press a

81
19:58:40,000 --> 20:54:40,000
button

83
20:13:19,000 --> 21:25:19,000
for instance well a number button at

85
20:54:40,000 --> 22:01:20,000
least we want to pass that number

87
21:25:19,000 --> 22:29:20,000
into a function on our in our python

89
22:01:20,000 --> 23:06:40,000
file and then do something with it

91
22:29:20,000 --> 23:22:39,000
right so let's start out with this one

93
23:06:40,000 --> 23:50:40,000
and i'm just going to go

95
23:22:39,000 --> 00:13:20,000
on underscore press like we've done

97
23:50:40,000 --> 01:09:20,000
before let's go

99
00:13:20,000 --> 01:26:40,000
root dot and let's call this button

101
01:09:20,000 --> 02:04:00,000
underscore press

103
01:26:40,000 --> 02:32:00,000
because it's very original very original

105
02:04:00,000 --> 03:26:39,000
name and let's just pass in

107
02:32:00,000 --> 03:37:19,000
seven right so this is the seven key the

109
03:26:39,000 --> 04:04:00,000
seven

111
03:37:19,000 --> 04:33:19,000
button we're just going to pass in the

113
04:04:00,000 --> 04:55:59,000
number seven into this function now we

115
04:33:19,000 --> 05:20:00,000
haven't created this function yet we'll

117
04:55:59,000 --> 05:50:39,000
do that in just a second so

119
05:20:00,000 --> 06:20:00,000
i can just copy this and we can come

121
05:50:39,000 --> 06:46:39,000
through here and let's just

123
06:20:00,000 --> 07:17:20,000
for each of these i know this is very

125
06:46:39,000 --> 07:22:40,000
exciting but we'll just sort of paste

127
07:17:20,000 --> 08:15:59,000
this

129
07:22:40,000 --> 08:41:20,000
in so we've got nine there's probably a

131
08:15:59,000 --> 09:30:40,000
faster way to do this but it's monday

133
08:41:20,000 --> 10:11:59,000
morning so we're just gonna kind of

135
09:30:40,000 --> 10:22:39,000
manually plow through this here so this

137
10:11:59,000 --> 11:26:40,000
is gonna be

139
10:22:39,000 --> 12:06:40,000
five and this will be

141
11:26:40,000 --> 12:50:40,000
six put a little space after each one

143
12:06:40,000 --> 12:50:40,000
just for fun

145
12:53:20,000 --> 14:37:20,000
one almost done

147
13:44:00,000 --> 15:29:20,000
and this one will be two and there we go

149
14:37:20,000 --> 15:57:20,000
this one will be it will be three

151
15:29:20,000 --> 16:40:00,000
and then we've got some more and let's

153
15:57:20,000 --> 17:11:59,000
also do zero for now

155
16:40:00,000 --> 17:33:19,000
and we'll leave the rest of these for

157
17:11:59,000 --> 17:52:00,000
later but

159
17:33:19,000 --> 18:18:39,000
okay we've got all these numbers now

161
17:52:00,000 --> 18:42:40,000
we've got this button press function we

163
18:18:39,000 --> 19:05:20,000
need to actually create it so let's head

165
18:42:40,000 --> 19:53:20,000
back over to our calc.pi

167
19:05:20,000 --> 20:14:40,000
file and inside of our my layout widget

169
19:53:20,000 --> 21:01:20,000
let's

171
20:14:40,000 --> 21:15:59,000
comment this and create a button

173
21:01:20,000 --> 22:06:40,000
pressing

175
21:15:59,000 --> 22:48:00,000
function right whatever

177
22:06:40,000 --> 23:14:40,000
so let's define press button and we want

179
22:48:00,000 --> 23:41:20,000
to pass in self and let's pass in a

181
23:14:40,000 --> 00:17:20,000
variable called button

183
23:41:20,000 --> 00:52:00,000
right so whenever we come over here and

185
00:17:20,000 --> 01:37:20,000
click on one of these for instance zero

187
00:52:00,000 --> 02:09:20,000
we're p we're passing in zero and that

189
01:37:20,000 --> 02:21:20,000
zero will be assigned to this button

191
02:09:20,000 --> 02:45:20,000
variable

193
02:21:20,000 --> 03:21:19,000
and then inside of this function we can

195
02:45:20,000 --> 03:43:59,000
do whatever we want with it okay so what

197
03:21:19,000 --> 04:20:00,000
do we want to do with it well

199
03:43:59,000 --> 04:54:40,000
remember our calculator when it starts

201
04:20:00,000 --> 05:09:20,000
there's a zero sitting in the text box

203
04:54:40,000 --> 05:53:20,000
at the top

205
05:09:20,000 --> 06:19:59,000
well if there's a zero we we probably

207
05:53:20,000 --> 07:12:00,000
want to get rid of that zero

209
06:19:59,000 --> 07:37:19,000
right it's just sort of there for visual

211
07:12:00,000 --> 08:04:00,000
purposes it doesn't really do anything

213
07:37:19,000 --> 08:37:20,000
at this point so we need to

215
08:04:00,000 --> 09:00:00,000
run a little if statement to say hey is

217
08:37:20,000 --> 09:54:40,000
there a zero there so

219
09:00:00,000 --> 11:16:00,000
i'm going to create a variable

221
09:54:40,000 --> 12:20:00,000
that contains whatever

223
11:16:00,000 --> 13:17:20,000
was in the text box already

225
12:20:00,000 --> 13:45:19,000
all right okay that is a long comment so

227
13:17:20,000 --> 14:29:19,000
i'm just i'm going to call this prior

229
13:45:19,000 --> 14:50:39,000
whatever was priorly priorly whatever

231
14:29:19,000 --> 15:16:00,000
was previously in there

233
14:50:39,000 --> 15:44:00,000
we'll assign it to this variable and so

235
15:16:00,000 --> 16:38:40,000
we get that by calling self

237
15:44:00,000 --> 17:20:00,000
dot ids dot calc underscore

239
16:38:40,000 --> 17:41:20,000
input dot text and you remember from the

241
17:20:00,000 --> 18:10:39,000
last video if we

243
17:41:20,000 --> 18:42:39,000
head up to the top first thing here our

245
18:10:39,000 --> 18:54:39,000
text input we give it an id of calc

247
18:42:39,000 --> 19:48:00,000
input

249
18:54:39,000 --> 20:20:00,000
so we're calling whatever the i whatever

251
19:48:00,000 --> 20:49:20,000
has the id of calc input

253
20:20:00,000 --> 21:18:39,000
what is the text that's in there well

255
20:49:20,000 --> 22:23:59,000
whatever it is assign it to prior

257
21:18:39,000 --> 23:19:59,000
so now let's run an if statement

259
22:23:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and let's uh determine

261
23:19:59,000 --> 01:21:20,000
if zero is sitting there

263
00:16:00,000 --> 02:21:20,000
right so let's go if prior

265
01:21:20,000 --> 02:50:40,000
equals zero what do we want to do well

267
02:21:20,000 --> 02:57:20,000
if it's zero we probably want to get rid

269
02:50:40,000 --> 03:41:19,000
of it

271
02:57:20,000 --> 03:48:00,000
we don't want the zero there most likely

273
03:41:19,000 --> 04:28:00,000
so

275
03:48:00,000 --> 04:45:20,000
we can go we could just call this thing

277
04:28:00,000 --> 05:18:40,000
right here

279
04:45:20,000 --> 05:50:40,000
so let me just copy this so we can set

281
05:18:40,000 --> 06:20:00,000
that equal to nothing

283
05:50:40,000 --> 06:53:20,000
and what else do we want to do well

285
06:20:00,000 --> 07:29:20,000
let's say we press the 9 button

287
06:53:20,000 --> 07:55:59,000
we want 9 to show up in the text box so

289
07:29:20,000 --> 08:24:00,000
we need to add that there

291
07:55:59,000 --> 09:00:00,000
so let's do this i'm going to add this

293
08:24:00,000 --> 09:25:20,000
as an f string and let's just pass in

295
09:00:00,000 --> 10:09:19,000
button

297
09:25:20,000 --> 10:36:00,000
so remember this button gets assigned

299
10:09:19,000 --> 11:00:00,000
whatever the number of the button is

301
10:36:00,000 --> 11:08:00,000
that we click so if we click the nine

303
11:00:00,000 --> 11:38:40,000
button

305
11:08:00,000 --> 12:06:40,000
we'll get rid of the zero and we'll add

307
11:38:40,000 --> 12:48:00,000
and we'll put nine in there

309
12:06:40,000 --> 13:16:00,000
right so let's go ahead and save this

311
12:48:00,000 --> 14:33:20,000
and run it just to see if that worked

313
13:16:00,000 --> 15:29:20,000
let's go python calc dot pi

315
14:33:20,000 --> 15:58:40,000
so we can say 7 boom 7 appears now it

317
15:29:20,000 --> 16:34:40,000
doesn't do anything else because 0

319
15:58:40,000 --> 17:02:40,000
is not sitting there right so if we go

321
16:34:40,000 --> 17:58:39,000
back to 0 and click 3

323
17:02:40,000 --> 18:10:39,000
it does something so ok that works now

325
17:58:39,000 --> 18:42:40,000
we

327
18:10:39,000 --> 19:08:00,000
need an else statement so we've got if

329
18:42:40,000 --> 20:02:40,000
if it equals 0

331
19:08:00,000 --> 20:02:40,000
do this else

333
20:09:19,000 --> 21:05:20,000
what do we want to do well we want to

335
20:53:20,000 --> 21:45:20,000
put

337
21:05:20,000 --> 21:56:00,000
say we click the 9 and the 9 is sitting

339
21:45:20,000 --> 22:38:40,000
there

341
21:56:00,000 --> 23:04:00,000
but we want to say 97 so we want to

343
22:38:40,000 --> 23:26:40,000
click the 7 button so we

345
23:04:00,000 --> 23:54:40,000
the 9 is already sitting there so we

347
23:26:40,000 --> 00:38:39,000
need to account for that and we need to

349
23:54:40,000 --> 01:08:00,000
put the 7 behind it so it'll say 97

351
00:38:39,000 --> 01:45:19,000
right so we can do that just by going

353
01:08:00,000 --> 02:22:40,000
self well we can just copy this whole

355
01:45:19,000 --> 02:22:40,000
thing

357
02:36:00,000 --> 03:42:40,000
and paste that in there let's give us

359
03:22:39,000 --> 04:18:40,000
some space here

361
03:42:40,000 --> 04:50:39,000
and inside of here we want another f

363
04:18:40,000 --> 05:10:40,000
string and we want to put whatever was

365
04:50:39,000 --> 06:01:20,000
in there prior

367
05:10:40,000 --> 06:44:00,000
first so we could go prior and then we

369
06:01:20,000 --> 07:44:00,000
also want to put whatever the button is

371
06:44:00,000 --> 08:40:00,000
so if nine was there already

373
07:44:00,000 --> 09:34:40,000
so prior will become nine

375
08:40:00,000 --> 10:26:39,000
this is false so this won't get run but

377
09:34:40,000 --> 11:05:20,000
this will and it will put nine here

379
10:26:39,000 --> 11:23:59,000
as prior plus then whatever we click the

381
11:05:20,000 --> 11:51:59,000
second time

383
11:23:59,000 --> 12:22:40,000
seven for instance or whatever so okay

385
11:51:59,000 --> 13:01:19,000
let's save this and run it see if that

387
12:22:40,000 --> 13:01:19,000
worked

389
13:20:00,000 --> 15:18:40,000
so we can say 97

391
14:21:20,000 --> 15:50:39,000
or 973 or 9730.

393
15:18:40,000 --> 16:10:40,000
we could just keep clicking things and

395
15:50:39,000 --> 16:49:20,000
they keep appearing

397
16:10:40,000 --> 17:12:00,000
on there so okay that works good now if

399
16:49:20,000 --> 17:39:59,000
we keep going you'll notice

401
17:12:00,000 --> 18:10:39,000
boom it disappears we'll need to fix

403
17:39:59,000 --> 18:42:40,000
that but we'll do that much later

405
18:10:39,000 --> 19:04:00,000
we'll just leave that for now now let's

407
18:42:40,000 --> 19:42:40,000
work on the plus sign

409
19:04:00,000 --> 20:18:40,000
so when we've got 9 here say we want to

411
19:42:40,000 --> 21:02:40,000
add 3 we would click this plus sign

413
20:18:40,000 --> 21:22:40,000
when we do that i want the plus sign to

415
21:02:40,000 --> 22:01:20,000
appear right there

417
21:22:40,000 --> 22:25:19,000
right so then we can also hit 3 again

419
22:01:20,000 --> 23:05:20,000
and then 3 will appear

421
22:25:19,000 --> 23:33:20,000
so that's what we'll do when we click

423
23:05:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the plus sign so let's do that now

425
23:33:20,000 --> 00:40:00,000
so let's head over to our calc thing and

427
00:09:20,000 --> 01:16:00,000
let's let's look for our plus sign and

429
00:40:00,000 --> 01:54:40,000
i'm just going to do a quick search here

431
01:16:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
so here's our plus button get rid of

433
01:54:40,000 --> 02:48:00,000
that

435
02:08:00,000 --> 03:05:20,000
now let's create an on underscore press

437
02:48:00,000 --> 03:48:00,000
for this guy

439
03:05:20,000 --> 03:56:00,000
and let's go root dot let's call this

441
03:48:00,000 --> 04:36:00,000
add

443
03:56:00,000 --> 04:49:20,000
let's create an add function right so

445
04:36:00,000 --> 05:42:40,000
okay

447
04:49:20,000 --> 06:49:20,000
we can save this head back over here

449
05:42:40,000 --> 06:49:20,000
and let's come in here and

451
06:54:40,000 --> 08:48:00,000
let's create addition

453
07:49:20,000 --> 09:17:20,000
function so let's define add

455
08:48:00,000 --> 09:46:39,000
and we also want to pass in self now

457
09:17:20,000 --> 10:10:39,000
when we did this button press one we

459
09:46:39,000 --> 10:31:59,000
also passed in the button

461
10:10:39,000 --> 10:54:40,000
we don't need to do that here because

463
10:31:59,000 --> 11:21:19,000
we're not passing in anything when we

465
10:54:40,000 --> 12:09:19,000
press the plus we just want to

467
11:21:19,000 --> 12:18:39,000
press plus right so okay that's pretty

469
12:09:19,000 --> 12:50:40,000
easy

471
12:18:39,000 --> 13:21:20,000
so again we want to do the same thing

473
12:50:40,000 --> 13:56:00,000
here grab whatever was

475
13:21:20,000 --> 14:21:20,000
previously in the text field so let's

477
13:56:00,000 --> 15:07:59,000
just paste that in

479
14:21:20,000 --> 15:22:40,000
and assign it to this prior variable

481
15:07:59,000 --> 15:50:39,000
right

483
15:22:40,000 --> 16:23:59,000
now all we want to do is take whatever

485
15:50:39,000 --> 16:40:00,000
was previously in there and slap a plus

487
16:23:59,000 --> 17:34:40,000
sign to the end of it

489
16:40:00,000 --> 17:48:00,000
right so we could do that just by

491
17:34:40,000 --> 18:38:40,000
calling

493
17:48:00,000 --> 19:34:20,000
this so

495
18:38:40,000 --> 20:02:40,000
let's say slap a plus sign

497
19:34:20,000 --> 20:57:20,000
[Music]

499
20:02:40,000 --> 21:47:59,000
to the text box whatever

501
20:57:20,000 --> 21:59:59,000
so we could just call that self.ids.calc

503
21:47:59,000 --> 22:36:00,000
dot

505
21:59:59,000 --> 22:54:39,000
calc underscore input.txt and we just

507
22:36:00,000 --> 23:38:40,000
set that equal to

509
22:54:39,000 --> 23:49:20,000
let's do another f string here because

511
23:38:40,000 --> 00:21:20,000
it's just

513
23:49:20,000 --> 00:53:19,000
easier that way and what do we want to

515
00:21:20,000 --> 01:30:39,000
do well we want to take whatever

517
00:53:19,000 --> 01:56:00,000
well we want to take whatever was

519
01:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,000
previously in there or

521
01:56:00,000 --> 03:04:00,000
prior as we're calling it and then we

523
02:30:40,000 --> 03:38:39,000
just want to slap a plus sign

525
03:04:00,000 --> 04:28:00,000
on after it so we go ahead and save this

527
03:38:39,000 --> 05:20:00,000
let's run this guy

529
04:28:00,000 --> 05:56:00,000
we can go eight plus boom the plus sign

531
05:20:00,000 --> 06:34:40,000
appears now we can say two

533
05:56:00,000 --> 06:46:40,000
we can keep going plus three plus six

535
06:34:40,000 --> 07:24:00,000
whatever

537
06:46:40,000 --> 07:52:00,000
and we're good to go so now we just need

539
07:24:00,000 --> 08:19:59,000
to work on this equal to

541
07:52:00,000 --> 08:48:00,000
and likewise we could do the same thing

543
08:19:59,000 --> 09:11:59,000
for the minus multiplication and

545
08:48:00,000 --> 09:44:00,000
subtraction if we wanted to

547
09:11:59,000 --> 10:04:00,000
we could knock that out real quick just

549
09:44:00,000 --> 10:46:40,000
right here

551
10:04:00,000 --> 11:34:40,000
so let's go let's just look through here

553
10:46:40,000 --> 11:34:40,000
for each of these

555
11:50:40,000 --> 13:06:40,000
here's the minus one we can go on

557
12:37:19,000 --> 14:38:40,000
underscore press

559
13:06:40,000 --> 15:16:00,000
and let's call root.subtract

561
14:38:40,000 --> 15:38:40,000
let me just copy this and we can keep

563
15:16:00,000 --> 16:12:00,000
looking through here here's the

565
15:38:40,000 --> 17:14:40,000
multiplication so we can call

567
16:12:00,000 --> 17:45:20,000
root dot multiply

569
17:14:40,000 --> 18:33:20,000
and let's change this to a lowercase x

571
17:45:20,000 --> 18:53:19,000
that's kind of bugging me it looks weird

573
18:33:20,000 --> 19:40:00,000
and we can come up here and here's the

575
18:53:19,000 --> 20:08:00,000
multiplication we'll call root dot

577
19:40:00,000 --> 20:41:20,000
or here's the division we'll call root

579
20:08:00,000 --> 21:04:00,000
dot divide all right so let's go ahead

581
20:41:20,000 --> 21:50:40,000
and save these

583
21:04:00,000 --> 22:03:59,000
now just very quickly you can just sort

585
21:50:40,000 --> 22:50:40,000
of copy

587
22:03:59,000 --> 22:50:40,000
each of these

589
22:57:20,000 --> 00:54:39,000
we want one two

591
00:04:00,000 --> 01:36:00,000
three add three more so

593
00:54:39,000 --> 01:36:00,000
let's see

595
01:54:40,000 --> 03:37:19,000
this one was subtract

597
02:46:40,000 --> 04:06:40,000
and then down here we just wanna slap a

599
03:37:19,000 --> 04:47:59,000
subtract sign

601
04:06:40,000 --> 05:07:59,000
instead of a plus sign right this one

603
04:47:59,000 --> 06:08:00,000
will be

605
05:07:59,000 --> 06:49:20,000
multiply and again down here

607
06:08:00,000 --> 07:01:19,000
we want the let's put a little star here

609
06:49:20,000 --> 07:53:20,000
that's the

611
07:01:19,000 --> 08:00:00,000
shift in the 8 key on your keyboard and

613
07:53:20,000 --> 09:09:20,000
then

615
08:00:00,000 --> 10:02:39,000
finally this one will be divide

617
09:09:20,000 --> 10:57:20,000
and at the bottom of this guy we'll put

619
10:02:39,000 --> 11:13:20,000
what that division sign so okay now

621
10:57:20,000 --> 11:33:19,000
let's see let's go ahead and save this

623
11:13:20,000 --> 12:12:00,000
and run it real quick just to make sure

625
11:33:19,000 --> 13:06:40,000
that worked we did that kind of fast

627
12:12:00,000 --> 13:22:39,000
so let's go nine times three that seems

629
13:06:40,000 --> 14:05:19,000
to work let's go

631
13:22:39,000 --> 14:19:59,000
nine divided by three that seems to work

633
14:05:19,000 --> 15:37:20,000
let's go nine

635
14:19:59,000 --> 16:29:20,000
minus oh subtract let's see

637
15:37:20,000 --> 16:41:20,000
i misspelled subtract right there okay

639
16:29:20,000 --> 17:49:19,000
so

641
16:41:20,000 --> 18:21:20,000
there you go that seems

643
17:49:19,000 --> 18:44:00,000
good let's run this again just to make

645
18:21:20,000 --> 19:34:39,000
sure so

647
18:44:00,000 --> 20:37:20,000
nine minus three okay

649
19:34:39,000 --> 20:49:20,000
and then nine plus three oops nine plus

651
20:37:20,000 --> 21:44:00,000
three

653
20:49:20,000 --> 22:13:20,000
all right so now we want to work on

655
21:44:00,000 --> 22:50:40,000
this equal to sign and we're just going

657
22:13:20,000 --> 23:17:20,000
to work on the addition one for now

659
22:50:40,000 --> 23:54:40,000
i will do the rest of these in the next

661
23:17:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
video but this is getting a little bit

663
23:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,000
long so

665
00:09:20,000 --> 01:11:59,000
okay let's head back over here and let's

667
00:54:40,000 --> 01:48:00,000
look through here

669
01:11:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
and i'm gonna just do a quick search for

671
01:48:00,000 --> 02:57:19,000
our equal to

673
02:04:00,000 --> 03:33:20,000
there it is and let's go on underscore

675
02:57:19,000 --> 04:49:20,000
press

677
03:33:20,000 --> 04:49:20,000
let's give this a root dot equals

679
04:52:00,000 --> 06:57:20,000
function go ahead and save this

681
05:47:59,000 --> 08:25:19,000
now let's come back up here

683
06:57:20,000 --> 08:25:19,000
and uh create equal

685
08:29:20,000 --> 10:04:00,000
equals to function and let's define

687
09:26:40,000 --> 10:28:00,000
equals we want to pass in self we don't

689
10:04:00,000 --> 10:50:40,000
need to pass in anything else

691
10:28:00,000 --> 11:38:40,000
and just like all of these things we

693
10:50:40,000 --> 12:32:00,000
need to know what was previously in

695
11:38:40,000 --> 13:01:19,000
our text box at the top right

697
12:32:00,000 --> 13:38:40,000
now this is going to get it interesting

699
13:01:19,000 --> 13:53:20,000
because this could be a long thing this

701
13:38:40,000 --> 14:49:20,000
could be

703
13:53:20,000 --> 15:43:59,000
9 plus 2 plus 6 plus nine plus

705
14:49:20,000 --> 16:13:20,000
four plus 106 or it could be four plus

707
15:43:59,000 --> 16:56:00,000
four it could be two things

709
16:13:20,000 --> 17:10:40,000
but it's it's going to be a string of

711
16:56:00,000 --> 17:49:20,000
text

713
17:10:40,000 --> 18:04:00,000
with a plus sign separating different

715
17:49:20,000 --> 18:38:40,000
things

717
18:04:00,000 --> 19:29:20,000
right so we need to sort of break this

719
18:38:40,000 --> 20:12:00,000
apart for

721
19:29:20,000 --> 20:30:40,000
whatever sign is in there and like i

723
20:12:00,000 --> 20:54:40,000
said right now we're going to do

725
20:30:40,000 --> 21:44:00,000
addition so let's do

727
20:54:40,000 --> 22:01:20,000
addition here and now we can we can

729
21:44:00,000 --> 22:58:40,000
determine if

731
22:01:20,000 --> 23:32:00,000
addition if the addition sign is in this

733
22:58:40,000 --> 00:03:59,000
variable right and we can do that just

735
23:32:00,000 --> 01:06:40,000
by calling if and we could go

737
00:03:59,000 --> 01:42:40,000
the plus sign in prior

739
01:06:40,000 --> 02:02:39,000
right so if there's a plus sign in there

741
01:42:40,000 --> 03:03:59,000
what do we want to do

743
02:02:39,000 --> 03:57:19,000
well we need to split apart this string

745
03:03:59,000 --> 04:56:00,000
by the plus sign and so we can do that

747
03:57:19,000 --> 05:16:00,000
we can call let's create a a list a

749
04:56:00,000 --> 05:58:40,000
python list called

751
05:16:00,000 --> 06:09:20,000
number list right and this is going to

753
05:58:40,000 --> 07:01:20,000
equal

755
06:09:20,000 --> 07:13:20,000
prior dot split we want to split it

757
07:01:20,000 --> 07:37:20,000
apart

759
07:13:20,000 --> 08:16:00,000
what do we want to split it by we want

761
07:37:20,000 --> 09:10:39,000
to split it by the plus sign

763
08:16:00,000 --> 10:13:19,000
right so this will now give us a

765
09:10:39,000 --> 10:40:00,000
python list of all of the numbers

767
10:13:19,000 --> 11:05:19,000
split apart by the plus sign so let's

769
10:40:00,000 --> 11:32:00,000
just print this out real quick

771
11:05:19,000 --> 11:54:40,000
num underscore list just to see what

773
11:32:00,000 --> 12:34:40,000
this looks like so let's save this and

775
11:54:40,000 --> 12:34:40,000
run it

777
12:41:19,000 --> 14:19:59,000
so we've got let's say 9 plus 3 plus

779
13:37:19,000 --> 14:48:00,000
2. we hit equal nothing happens but when

781
14:19:59,000 --> 15:02:40,000
we close this we should see a python

783
14:48:00,000 --> 15:52:00,000
list with 9

785
15:02:40,000 --> 16:34:39,000
3 and 2 in it and we do we see a python

787
15:52:00,000 --> 17:24:00,000
list right here with 9 3 and 2 in it now

789
16:34:39,000 --> 17:42:40,000
check this out though these are

791
17:24:00,000 --> 18:09:19,000
quotation marks

793
17:42:40,000 --> 18:30:40,000
which means these aren't numbers these

795
18:09:19,000 --> 19:01:19,000
are strings so we're going to have to

797
18:30:40,000 --> 19:25:19,000
convert them into numbers into integers

799
19:01:19,000 --> 20:16:00,000
and if we want to do math

801
19:25:19,000 --> 21:08:00,000
which we do so let's go ahead and

803
20:16:00,000 --> 21:38:39,000
do that now so we don't need this

805
21:08:00,000 --> 22:10:40,000
let's create a variable called answer

807
21:38:39,000 --> 22:48:00,000
and let's set this equal to zero

809
22:10:40,000 --> 23:09:19,000
or i guess we could set it equal to zero

811
22:48:00,000 --> 00:06:39,000
like that

813
23:09:19,000 --> 01:12:00,000
so now let's create a loop so let's loop

815
00:06:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
through our list so let's go four

817
01:12:00,000 --> 02:10:39,000
let's say let's call this number for a

819
01:38:40,000 --> 03:21:19,000
number in our

821
02:10:39,000 --> 04:14:39,000
num underscore list we want the answer

823
03:21:19,000 --> 05:15:59,000
to equal answer

825
04:14:39,000 --> 05:49:19,000
plus our number but remember

827
05:15:59,000 --> 06:36:00,000
this number is a string so we need to

829
05:49:19,000 --> 07:06:40,000
convert this to an integer

831
06:36:00,000 --> 07:33:19,000
let's go ahead and do that and then when

833
07:06:40,000 --> 08:21:19,000
this is all done let's just

835
07:33:19,000 --> 08:44:00,000
um let's just print out answer just to

837
08:21:19,000 --> 09:03:59,000
see if this is working so

839
08:44:00,000 --> 09:29:20,000
all right let's go ahead and save this

841
09:03:59,000 --> 09:44:00,000
we need we may need to fiddle with this

843
09:29:20,000 --> 10:14:40,000
a bit

845
09:44:00,000 --> 10:37:20,000
so let's bring this over let's say nine

847
10:14:40,000 --> 11:25:20,000
plus one

849
10:37:20,000 --> 11:31:59,000
equals nothing happens when we close

851
11:25:20,000 --> 12:18:40,000
this

853
11:31:59,000 --> 12:25:20,000
boom it shows us 10 down here so all

855
12:18:40,000 --> 13:02:39,000
right

857
12:25:20,000 --> 13:22:40,000
that seems to work now all we have to do

859
13:02:39,000 --> 13:33:20,000
is instead of printing this to the

861
13:22:40,000 --> 14:23:59,000
terminal

863
13:33:20,000 --> 15:01:19,000
we just want to print this to this thing

865
14:23:59,000 --> 15:28:00,000
right so let me just copy this and let's

867
15:01:19,000 --> 17:18:40,000
just come down here and say

869
15:28:00,000 --> 18:05:20,000
uh print the answer in the text box

871
17:18:40,000 --> 18:20:00,000
so we can set that equal to and let's

873
18:05:20,000 --> 18:59:59,000
just go

875
18:20:00,000 --> 18:59:59,000
answer

877
19:10:40,000 --> 20:09:20,000
now this may not work because this is

879
19:45:20,000 --> 20:41:20,000
now an integer

881
20:09:20,000 --> 21:21:20,000
so we're placing an integer in a text

883
20:41:20,000 --> 21:59:59,000
box so let's go ahead and run it and see

885
21:21:20,000 --> 22:13:20,000
if that will work or not so let's go

887
21:59:59,000 --> 23:11:59,000
nine plus

889
22:13:20,000 --> 23:57:20,000
one nope we get an error

891
23:11:59,000 --> 00:13:19,000
so we need to convert this into a string

893
23:57:20,000 --> 01:04:00,000
as i

895
00:13:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
suspected so we could just go string

897
01:04:00,000 --> 02:22:39,000
wrap that in a string function all right

899
01:37:20,000 --> 02:22:39,000
now that should work

901
02:49:20,000 --> 04:41:19,000
let's go nine plus one boom ten

903
03:45:20,000 --> 05:53:20,000
and that's it so we can you know 55

905
04:41:19,000 --> 06:39:59,000
plus 5 plus 10 what's that gonna be 70

907
05:53:20,000 --> 07:02:39,000
boom 70 and just that easy and we can

909
06:39:59,000 --> 08:05:19,000
keep going 70 plus

911
07:02:39,000 --> 09:10:40,000
uh 10 gonna be 80 right

913
08:05:19,000 --> 09:21:19,000
plus six very cool and just that easy so

915
09:10:40,000 --> 09:50:39,000
again just

917
09:21:19,000 --> 10:12:00,000
to look through here when we press the

919
09:50:39,000 --> 10:44:00,000
equal to button we want to

921
10:12:00,000 --> 11:09:20,000
put whatever is previously in the text

923
10:44:00,000 --> 11:45:20,000
box in this variable

925
11:09:20,000 --> 12:10:40,000
then we want to split it apart so if

927
11:45:20,000 --> 12:55:59,000
it's 9 plus 3

929
12:10:40,000 --> 13:10:39,000
we want to split the 9 and the 3 apart

931
12:55:59,000 --> 13:40:00,000
by

933
13:10:39,000 --> 14:11:59,000
the plus sign so we want to pull out the

935
13:40:00,000 --> 15:02:40,000
plus sign and put everything else

937
14:11:59,000 --> 15:33:19,000
into a python list so

939
15:02:40,000 --> 16:00:00,000
then we want to loop through this list

941
15:33:19,000 --> 16:43:59,000
and add the things together

943
16:00:00,000 --> 17:20:00,000
right when we do we assign them to this

945
16:43:59,000 --> 17:34:40,000
answer variable that we set to zero up

947
17:20:00,000 --> 18:29:19,000
here

949
17:34:40,000 --> 18:52:00,000
and then finally we just slap it back

951
18:29:19,000 --> 19:24:00,000
into the input box

953
18:52:00,000 --> 20:01:20,000
but remember to convert it to a string

955
19:24:00,000 --> 20:16:00,000
first because i guess input boxes like

957
20:01:20,000 --> 20:43:59,000
strings

959
20:16:00,000 --> 21:06:40,000
and that's all there is to it so we went

961
20:43:59,000 --> 21:30:39,000
through a bunch of stuff in this video

963
21:06:40,000 --> 21:49:19,000
but it was all pretty simple stuff you

965
21:30:39,000 --> 22:28:00,000
know we clicked the buttons

967
21:49:19,000 --> 22:50:40,000
so we're now assigning whatever was in

969
22:28:00,000 --> 23:24:00,000
the whatever the button is

971
22:50:40,000 --> 23:43:59,000
to the text box so if we press nine the

973
23:24:00,000 --> 00:21:19,000
nine appears

975
23:43:59,000 --> 01:05:20,000
now we when we press plus the plus

977
00:21:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
appears and then when we press equal

979
01:05:20,000 --> 02:10:40,000
it adds them all up it figures out that

981
01:37:20,000 --> 02:46:39,000
this is a addition

983
02:10:40,000 --> 03:06:40,000
and uh it does stuff now for the rest of

985
02:46:39,000 --> 03:22:40,000
these we'll do the same thing we'll do

987
03:06:40,000 --> 04:00:00,000
another if statement

989
03:22:40,000 --> 04:14:40,000
if instead of plus you know we'll do

991
04:00:00,000 --> 05:06:40,000
minus right

993
04:14:40,000 --> 05:30:40,000
whatever now the inside stuff this stuff

995
05:06:40,000 --> 05:40:00,000
in here will be different for each one

997
05:30:40,000 --> 06:02:39,000
minus

999
05:40:00,000 --> 06:38:40,000
multiplication and division and we'll

1001
06:02:39,000 --> 07:04:00,000
see why probably in the next video

1003
06:38:40,000 --> 07:34:40,000
but uh pretty easy and we're coming

1005
07:04:00,000 --> 07:57:20,000
right along so that's all for this video

1007
07:34:40,000 --> 08:19:59,000
