00:00:30,000 --> 01:09:00,000
hey guys and welcome back from the kV

3
00:37:30,000 --> 01:47:00,000
tutorial so in today's video we're gonna

5
01:09:00,000 --> 02:16:29,000
be going through how to change screens

7
01:47:00,000 --> 02:50:30,000
so essentially having multiple windows

9
02:16:29,000 --> 03:25:00,000
and then doing some kind of transition

11
02:50:30,000 --> 03:57:30,000
between them based on like an event

13
03:25:00,000 --> 04:16:29,000
occurs so the exact example that I'm

15
03:57:30,000 --> 04:53:29,000
gonna be using is we're gonna have a

17
04:16:29,000 --> 05:21:00,000
login form and if you type in the

19
04:53:29,000 --> 05:37:30,000
password correctly it'll move you to the

21
05:21:00,000 --> 06:08:29,000
next page

23
05:37:30,000 --> 06:31:00,000
if not then obviously it won't move you

25
06:08:29,000 --> 06:59:00,000
there so this is actually quite a few

27
06:31:00,000 --> 07:33:30,000
steps so make sure you guys follow along

29
06:59:00,000 --> 08:18:00,000
closely and as always all the code will

31
07:33:30,000 --> 08:46:30,000
be up on tech with Tim net ok so what

33
08:18:00,000 --> 09:10:00,000
we're actually gonna start by doing is

35
08:46:30,000 --> 09:49:30,000
something different that we haven't done

37
09:10:00,000 --> 10:17:00,000
yet so notice that I change the name of

39
09:49:30,000 --> 10:37:30,000
my main app I've just deleted

41
10:17:00,000 --> 11:27:30,000
essentially everything there's nothing

43
10:37:30,000 --> 12:21:00,000
in my KB file to my main app instead of

45
11:27:30,000 --> 12:52:00,000
just my app so now this Cavey file won't

47
12:21:00,000 --> 13:40:00,000
actually load incorrectly if we remember

49
12:52:00,000 --> 14:00:30,000
the naming conventions from before so

51
13:40:00,000 --> 14:32:00,000
what I want to do is only use something

53
14:00:30,000 --> 15:17:00,000
called a builder which will allow us to

55
14:32:00,000 --> 15:42:59,000
load in the KB file no matter what the

57
15:17:00,000 --> 16:22:00,000
name of it is so let's just start by

59
15:42:59,000 --> 17:16:59,000
importing it so I leave us from K V dot

61
16:22:00,000 --> 17:33:59,000
Lang we're gonna import builder and then

63
17:16:59,000 --> 18:17:20,000
what we're gonna do is just type right

65
17:33:59,000 --> 19:56:00,000
above our class we'll say K V equals

67
18:17:20,000 --> 20:29:59,000
builder if I could type load underscore

69
19:56:00,000 --> 20:51:00,000
file believe that's the name and then

71
20:29:59,000 --> 21:35:00,000
what we'll do is put the name of our

73
20:51:00,000 --> 22:18:30,000
file so my dot K V and what we're gonna

75
21:35:00,000 --> 23:09:29,000
do now is we're just gonna return K V

77
22:18:30,000 --> 23:27:00,000
from this my main app so essentially

79
23:09:29,000 --> 23:49:59,000
what this is gonna do is this she's

81
23:27:00,000 --> 00:13:30,000
gonna load up this file it doesn't

83
23:49:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
matter what the name of this file is now

85
00:13:30,000 --> 01:42:29,000
and we're gonna return this file when

87
01:06:00,000 --> 02:11:30,000
we're building the app so like let's

89
01:42:29,000 --> 03:24:30,000
just do an example here if I say button

91
02:11:30,000 --> 04:23:00,000
and I say text and we'll just go like

93
03:24:30,000 --> 04:44:30,000
Tim and to see if this works just to

95
04:23:00,000 --> 05:23:00,000
test and there we go we see we get a

97
04:44:30,000 --> 05:50:30,000
button Tim and again because we're

99
05:23:00,000 --> 06:15:30,000
loading up this KB fall it's the way

101
05:50:30,000 --> 06:48:00,000
this builder thing works just you don't

103
06:15:30,000 --> 07:32:29,000
have to name your K V file like the same

105
06:48:00,000 --> 08:02:00,000
thing as the class ok so that's it for

107
07:32:29,000 --> 08:37:00,000
Builder so what we're gonna do now is

109
08:02:00,000 --> 09:05:30,000
since we're setting up screens we

111
08:37:00,000 --> 09:42:00,000
actually have to use something from

113
09:05:30,000 --> 10:08:29,000
Kibby which is well screens and screen

115
09:42:00,000 --> 11:21:30,000
managers what we're gonna do is going to

117
10:08:29,000 --> 12:14:30,000
say from Kivi dot UI x dot screen

119
11:21:30,000 --> 12:52:30,000
manager import screen manager and import

121
12:14:30,000 --> 13:05:00,000
screen so we're gonna set up three

123
12:52:30,000 --> 13:19:30,000
classes

125
13:05:00,000 --> 13:43:30,000
and they're not gonna have anything

127
13:19:30,000 --> 14:12:30,000
inside of them but they're just gonna

129
13:43:30,000 --> 14:50:30,000
dictate our different screens and then

131
14:12:30,000 --> 15:14:00,000
our screen manager so our first class

133
14:50:30,000 --> 16:16:30,000
will be our first window so I'm just

135
15:14:00,000 --> 16:47:30,000
gonna say this main window okay and this

137
16:16:30,000 --> 17:13:00,000
is just gonna inherit from screen and

139
16:47:30,000 --> 17:55:00,000
then all we have to do in here is just

141
17:13:00,000 --> 18:36:30,000
pass now I'll actually copy this and

143
17:55:00,000 --> 19:35:30,000
paste this and instead of having main

145
18:36:30,000 --> 20:01:30,000
window we'll do second window and then

147
19:35:30,000 --> 20:55:50,000
we'll paste this one more time and

149
20:01:30,000 --> 22:04:30,000
against the main window we're gonna do

151
20:55:50,000 --> 22:26:00,000
what is it window manager the names of

153
22:04:30,000 --> 23:01:00,000
these don't really matter as long as you

155
22:26:00,000 --> 23:40:20,000
remember what they are and that instead

157
23:01:00,000 --> 00:44:30,000
of screen we're gonna do screen manager

159
23:40:20,000 --> 01:05:00,000
okay screen manager so essentially what

161
00:44:30,000 --> 01:28:30,000
this is gonna do now is this is gonna

163
01:05:00,000 --> 01:56:00,000
represent our main window which is our

165
01:28:30,000 --> 02:43:00,000
login form this will represent the page

167
01:56:00,000 --> 03:38:30,000
we go to next and this window manager

169
02:43:00,000 --> 04:14:00,000
will just represent like the transitions

171
03:38:30,000 --> 04:50:30,000
and stuff between the windows okay so

173
04:14:00,000 --> 05:27:30,000
what we're gonna do now is what we will

175
04:50:30,000 --> 06:05:30,000
I think we may be done actually for the

177
05:27:30,000 --> 06:46:00,000
Python file so let's move over to the kV

179
06:05:30,000 --> 07:15:30,000
file and start setting some stuff up so

181
06:46:00,000 --> 07:54:29,000
the first thing we need to do is we're

183
07:15:30,000 --> 08:28:30,000
just gonna grab this window manager and

185
07:54:29,000 --> 08:52:30,000
we're gonna set what type of screens are

187
08:28:30,000 --> 09:32:30,000
what screens are going to be inside of

189
08:52:30,000 --> 10:25:00,000
this so the two screens we have our main

191
09:32:30,000 --> 11:04:30,000
window okay and then we also have a

193
10:25:00,000 --> 12:00:30,000
second window right so we'll put those

195
11:04:30,000 --> 12:32:00,000
in here like that and just leave these

197
12:00:30,000 --> 12:53:00,000
as you need a colon here and we're not

199
12:32:00,000 --> 13:22:30,000
gonna type anything else but you just

201
12:53:00,000 --> 13:54:30,000
need the colon because there is possible

203
13:22:30,000 --> 14:16:00,000
options you could put so this right now

205
13:54:30,000 --> 14:45:59,000
is just saying we're gonna have two

207
14:16:00,000 --> 15:10:59,000
windows main window in second window if

209
14:45:59,000 --> 16:12:00,000
you wanted to add a third window you do

211
15:10:59,000 --> 17:13:00,000
something like third window here if I

213
16:12:00,000 --> 17:23:20,000
could type this and yeah then that's how

215
17:13:00,000 --> 17:55:30,000
you do that

217
17:23:20,000 --> 18:20:30,000
but you'd also have to make sure that

219
17:55:30,000 --> 18:41:30,000
you have a third window class here and I

221
18:20:30,000 --> 18:58:00,000
think you guys probably get the point so

223
18:41:30,000 --> 19:33:00,000
what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna

225
18:58:00,000 --> 19:57:30,000
start creating the kind of forms for our

227
19:33:00,000 --> 20:29:30,000
different windows now this is really

229
19:57:30,000 --> 21:00:59,000
similar to what we've done before except

231
20:29:30,000 --> 21:25:00,000
we just need to add a few other things

233
21:00:59,000 --> 22:10:30,000
to it so essentially what we're gonna do

235
21:25:00,000 --> 22:54:29,000
is gonna go May in the window like this

237
22:10:30,000 --> 23:29:00,000
and then in here what we'll put is uh

239
22:54:29,000 --> 00:21:59,000
first need to give it a name now the

241
23:29:00,000 --> 00:55:30,000
name is gonna be how we what do you call

243
00:21:59,000 --> 01:20:30,000
it call it in terms of moving between

245
00:55:30,000 --> 01:57:30,000
screens so the name of this one we'll

247
01:20:30,000 --> 02:03:10,000
just call this main now we'll even just

249
01:57:30,000 --> 02:25:40,000
we'll just

251
02:03:10,000 --> 03:26:10,000
the second window right now so we don't

253
02:25:40,000 --> 04:33:40,000
forget so second window and it's for the

255
03:26:10,000 --> 04:54:10,000
name here we'll just do second okay now

257
04:33:40,000 --> 05:14:10,000
again these names can be whatever you

259
04:54:10,000 --> 05:40:39,000
want just make sure you remember them

261
05:14:10,000 --> 06:18:39,000
because we are gonna have to use them so

263
05:40:39,000 --> 06:43:09,000
name main names second now all I'm gonna

265
06:18:39,000 --> 07:08:09,000
do in the second window notice - it's

267
06:43:09,000 --> 07:41:10,000
already here is just create a button and

269
07:08:09,000 --> 08:16:40,000
on my button all I'm gonna do is just

271
07:41:10,000 --> 08:59:10,000
have some text and that Texas is gonna

273
08:16:40,000 --> 09:41:40,000
say go back right because if we make it

275
08:59:10,000 --> 10:09:10,000
to this screen then we just want to be

277
09:41:40,000 --> 10:33:40,000
able to navigate back to the other

279
10:09:10,000 --> 11:07:09,000
screen so that's what we need for second

281
10:33:40,000 --> 11:53:10,000
window now for main window I want to set

283
11:07:09,000 --> 12:28:10,000
up this login form that essentially all

285
11:53:10,000 --> 13:16:10,000
it does is is just gonna have like a

287
12:28:10,000 --> 13:46:10,000
label a text input box and then a button

289
13:16:10,000 --> 14:06:40,000
so we're gonna do this similar to what

291
13:46:10,000 --> 14:31:40,000
we've done before with multiple grid

293
14:06:40,000 --> 15:14:40,000
layouts so in case you forget we're

295
14:31:40,000 --> 15:36:10,000
gonna do a grid layout and then for the

297
15:14:40,000 --> 16:51:40,000
first grid layout we're gonna have calls

299
15:36:10,000 --> 17:20:10,000
is one okay and then what should we put

301
16:51:40,000 --> 17:53:30,000
inside here we need to put another grid

303
17:20:10,000 --> 18:26:40,000
layout so the other grid layout will be

305
17:53:30,000 --> 18:56:10,000
calls too

307
18:26:40,000 --> 19:55:40,000
and then inside here we're gonna have a

309
18:56:10,000 --> 20:14:40,000
label and Wow okay I don't know what I

311
19:55:40,000 --> 20:59:40,000
just clicked to do that that was

313
20:14:40,000 --> 21:53:10,000
interesting and we'll say text and for

315
20:59:40,000 --> 22:34:39,000
this we'll just say is password okay

317
21:53:10,000 --> 23:00:10,000
colon and then we'll put a text input

319
22:34:39,000 --> 23:37:40,000
box and we're gonna need to give this an

321
23:00:10,000 --> 00:35:10,000
ID so the ID for this I'll just say is

323
23:37:40,000 --> 01:18:00,000
passed W okay and then in here what

325
00:35:10,000 --> 02:38:10,000
we'll do is we'll say for text input

327
01:18:00,000 --> 03:12:40,000
multi-line equals false okay so that's

329
02:38:10,000 --> 03:44:40,000
all we need for here now we actually

331
03:12:40,000 --> 04:25:10,000
know we need to add a button sorry give

333
03:44:40,000 --> 04:48:39,000
me on that one so add a button and this

335
04:25:10,000 --> 05:47:10,000
button is just gonna have a text that

337
04:48:39,000 --> 06:20:10,000
says submit and we're gonna have an on

339
05:47:10,000 --> 06:53:09,000
press event which were actually on

341
06:20:10,000 --> 07:14:40,000
release event which we'll do in just a

343
06:53:09,000 --> 07:37:40,000
second and we're gonna have a non

345
07:14:40,000 --> 08:02:10,000
release event here so let's just do that

347
07:37:40,000 --> 08:28:10,000
so we don't forget let's do a quick

349
08:02:10,000 --> 08:56:40,000
summary of what we've done so

351
08:28:10,000 --> 09:20:40,000
essentially this is all like this is

353
08:56:40,000 --> 09:56:40,000
probably a review except for this part

355
09:20:40,000 --> 10:26:09,000
here of what we've done before so we

357
09:56:40,000 --> 11:05:10,000
just created a very basic form all we're

359
10:26:09,000 --> 11:54:10,000
going to do is we have what do you call

361
11:05:10,000 --> 12:18:09,000
it the text input which is going to just

363
11:54:10,000 --> 12:41:40,000
ask you for a password you can type and

365
12:18:09,000 --> 13:12:40,000
password and then we're just gonna check

367
12:41:40,000 --> 13:42:10,000
here if the password is a certain value

369
13:12:40,000 --> 14:15:09,000
and if it is then we're going to

371
13:42:10,000 --> 14:35:40,000
transition to the other window so the

373
14:15:09,000 --> 15:04:09,000
way that we transition to the other

375
14:35:40,000 --> 16:16:29,000
windows is we

377
15:04:09,000 --> 17:05:10,000
you this we do app JA root dot current

379
16:16:29,000 --> 17:38:09,000
okay and then we set it equal to the

381
17:05:10,000 --> 18:09:09,000
window we want to go to so in this case

383
17:38:09,000 --> 18:38:39,000
if we hit submit we want to go to the

385
18:09:09,000 --> 19:06:39,000
second window that that is this right

387
18:38:39,000 --> 19:45:40,000
now the name of that window is second

389
19:06:39,000 --> 20:06:09,000
like we named it here so that's all

391
19:45:40,000 --> 20:46:39,000
we're gonna do we're gonna say app dot

393
20:06:09,000 --> 21:29:39,000
root current equals second now we can

395
20:46:39,000 --> 22:16:10,000
actually copy this and we can paste it

397
21:29:39,000 --> 22:44:39,000
right here as well and here though if we

399
22:16:10,000 --> 23:11:09,000
want to go back we won't want to do the

401
22:44:39,000 --> 23:50:09,000
name main so that's what we'll do and

403
23:11:09,000 --> 00:31:39,000
actually let's just tab this in here

405
23:50:09,000 --> 01:14:09,000
underneath on release and this should be

407
00:31:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
working fine so let's run this quickly

409
01:14:09,000 --> 02:01:40,000
and assuming I didn't make any mistakes

411
01:36:40,000 --> 02:46:30,000
which I probably did we should be

413
02:01:40,000 --> 03:51:09,000
working invalid property property name

415
02:46:30,000 --> 04:41:39,000
multi-line I can't do equals false I

417
03:51:09,000 --> 05:28:09,000
have to do : false believe that's the

419
04:41:39,000 --> 05:55:39,000
issue yes there we go okay so we have a

421
05:28:09,000 --> 06:25:39,000
little login window make it a bit

423
05:55:39,000 --> 06:58:09,000
smaller you can see it resizes so I'd

425
06:25:39,000 --> 07:33:09,000
type something in here hit submit and

427
06:58:09,000 --> 08:24:39,000
you can see it brings me over to my

429
07:33:09,000 --> 09:01:39,000
other page and then if I hit go back it

431
08:24:39,000 --> 09:31:09,000
brings me back now notice though that

433
09:01:39,000 --> 10:03:09,000
these transitions are probably not ideal

435
09:31:09,000 --> 10:24:39,000
moving like left right or just keep

437
10:03:09,000 --> 11:02:39,000
moving to the left but we want to go

439
10:24:39,000 --> 11:36:09,000
left and then to the right so how do we

441
11:02:39,000 --> 12:24:09,000
do that well luckily there is a way that

443
11:36:09,000 --> 12:50:09,000
we can do that so on the release here

445
12:24:09,000 --> 14:27:09,000
what we're actually gonna type in type

447
12:50:09,000 --> 15:06:29,000
root dot manager dot transition assuming

449
14:27:09,000 --> 16:08:39,000
I spell this correctly so root dot

451
15:06:29,000 --> 17:00:09,000
manager dot transition dot direction and

453
16:08:39,000 --> 17:19:09,000
then this is gonna be equal to what

455
17:00:09,000 --> 18:02:39,000
direction I wanted ghost in this case

457
17:19:09,000 --> 18:49:09,000
we're gonna go left okay and then if we

459
18:02:39,000 --> 19:38:39,000
copy this and we paste it here we can go

461
18:49:09,000 --> 20:32:39,000
right so now let's check this out and

463
19:38:39,000 --> 21:00:39,000
see if I did this correctly okay so if I

465
20:32:39,000 --> 21:32:39,000
hit submit you can see removing to the

467
21:00:39,000 --> 21:56:39,000
left now watch this if I hit go back we

469
21:32:39,000 --> 22:19:09,000
move to the right so you can see that

471
21:56:39,000 --> 23:02:39,000
it's kind of going back and forth and

473
22:19:09,000 --> 23:23:39,000
that's awesome okay so the last thing I

475
23:02:39,000 --> 23:47:39,000
want to do for this video is I want to

477
23:23:39,000 --> 00:22:39,000
make it so it only lets us go to the

479
23:47:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
next page if we type this password

481
00:22:39,000 --> 01:46:09,000
correctly right so how can we do that

483
00:55:40,000 --> 02:10:09,000
well we just need to do a little bit of

485
01:46:09,000 --> 02:42:10,000
logic inside of here

487
02:10:09,000 --> 03:11:10,000
so the reason we gave this an idea so

489
02:42:10,000 --> 03:45:39,000
that we can check the value so on on

491
03:11:10,000 --> 04:03:00,000
release here let's go in here and let's

493
03:45:39,000 --> 05:04:59,000
do a bit of logic

495
04:03:00,000 --> 06:21:30,000
let's just say if or we'll say second if

497
05:04:59,000 --> 06:48:00,000
and I will say Pass W dot txt equals

499
06:21:30,000 --> 07:40:00,000
equals and let's just make the password

501
06:48:00,000 --> 08:17:30,000
Tim in this case we'll say else we're

503
07:40:00,000 --> 08:53:30,000
just gonna stay on this main page so

505
08:17:30,000 --> 09:26:29,000
we'll go to second if the password is

507
08:53:30,000 --> 10:06:19,000
Tim otherwise we'll go we'll just stay

509
09:26:29,000 --> 10:49:30,000
on the main page okay so let's try this

511
10:06:19,000 --> 11:16:30,000
if I hit submit I'm not typing a

513
10:49:30,000 --> 12:14:00,000
password it's not working if I type T I

515
11:16:30,000 --> 12:50:30,000
doesn't work if I type Tim you can see

517
12:14:00,000 --> 13:22:59,000
we go to the next page and that is

519
12:50:30,000 --> 13:44:30,000
essentially oh we should probably

521
13:22:59,000 --> 14:41:00,000
actually would want to clear this as

523
13:44:30,000 --> 14:57:30,000
well so we could do that too you know

525
14:41:00,000 --> 15:22:00,000
what let's not worry about that right

527
14:57:30,000 --> 15:46:30,000
now how am I do in the next video but

529
15:22:00,000 --> 16:26:00,000
essentially that's how that works

531
15:46:30,000 --> 16:43:30,000
this is how we can go between multiple

533
16:26:00,000 --> 17:31:30,000
windows if you want to create another

535
16:43:30,000 --> 18:19:59,000
window create another class inherit from

537
17:31:30,000 --> 18:43:59,000
screen same thing here and then you can

539
18:19:59,000 --> 19:16:30,000
kind of lay out the navigation for

541
18:43:59,000 --> 19:38:30,000
yourself so if you guys enjoyed the

543
19:16:30,000 --> 20:03:30,000
video please make sure you leave a like

545
19:38:30,000 --> 20:25:20,000
and subscribe and I will see you again

547
20:03:30,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in another one
