975,ארגון הפניקס תרם רבות לגישור בין ממשלתנו לרפובליקת סמבקה במהלך השנתיים האחרונות ,As you all know the Phoenix Foundation has been playing an important role between our government and that of the Republic of Sambaka over the last two years ,The Phoenix organization has contributed greatly to mediation between our government and the Republic of Sambaka over the past two years,67

983,בכל זאת אדוני נותר לי רק לתהות האם אין לנו דברים חשובים יותר לעשות מאשר לתווך עם אישים קיצוניים שאינם מפגינים ולו טיפת כבוד לערכים הדמוקרטיים שלנו ,Still and all sir it just leaves me to wonder whether we don't have better things to do than to mediate with radicals who show absolutely no respect for our democratic values ,Yet sir I can only wonder if we have nothing more important to do than mediate with extremists who do not show even a drop of respect for our democratic values,61
984,-בחייך מאט אינך חושב שמאמצינו לקדם את מר אמונדה וממשלתו למתינות חשובים במידה שווה לפירוקו של נשק גרעיני נוסף ,Matt don't you think that our efforts to move Mr Amunde and his government toward moderation are just as important as disarming one more nuclear weapon ,- Come on Matt you do not think our efforts to advance Mr. Amonda and his government to moderation are equally important to the dismantling of another nuclear weapon,77
